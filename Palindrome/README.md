## String manipulation exercise - Palindrome

Write a fucntion that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is read the same from left to right as from right to left,
ignoring spaces and differentialing between case and emergency letters.

The method created uses Replace + Regex to remove any whitespace, and then it uses the reverse method to get the sentence or word in reverse order.
