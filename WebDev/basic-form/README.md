## WEB Development exercise - Contact Form

Create a simple web page containing a contact form with fields for name, email, subjcet and message.
When subbmitting the form, the data must be validated (for example, checking that the email field has a valid format) and displayed in an area below the form

Among the various options for controlling forms in React, I chose to use the React Hook Forms library because it is facilitative for both validations and control, as it eliminates several methods (onchange).
